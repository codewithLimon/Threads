You are tasked with implementing a simple simulation of bank transactions using Java threads. You need to create a BankAccount class
that represents a bank account and has methods for depositing, withdrawing and getting the current balance. You also need to create a
BankTransition class that represents a bank transaction and has a reference to a BankAccount Object, a boolean flag to indicate if it is
a deposit or withdrawal and an amount for the transaction.


 Using the above classes, you need to create a BankSimulation Class that creates  three threads, each represnting a bank transaction.
 The three threads should be started and executed concurrently, and each should access
the shared BankAccount Object to perform the transaction. The BankTransaction class should be synchronized on the BankAccount object to ensure
that only one transaction is executed at a time.

The initial balance of the bankAccount should be 1000, the first transacion should be a deposit
of 500, second transaction should be a withdrawal of 800 and the third transaction should be a deposit of 300. The final amount in the account
should be 1000.

After all threads have completed, the BankSimulation class should print the final balance of the bank account.

Write the java code for the BankAccount, BankTransaction, and BankSimulation classes to simulate the bank transactions.
